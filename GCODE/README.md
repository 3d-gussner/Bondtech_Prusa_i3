Theese files are used to set the new E-step value on the printer.
On MK2, MK2S and MK2.5 the Estep value should be 415 as it uses 16 bit microstepping, on MK3 it shall be 830 as it uses 32 bit microstepping, this is valid for standard 1.8 degree steppermotors, if a 0.9 degree motor is used the e-step needs to be doubled, so 830 and 1660.

Copy the file to the sd-card and put it in the printer, select to print the file and the new e-step value will be set and saved to the controller.
